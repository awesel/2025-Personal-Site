        Many AI products talk about their efficiency in terms of how much human
        labor the language model can replicate. Jared Kaplan, a co-founder of
        Anthropic, describes Claude's growing intelligence in terms of how many
        human thought-minutes Claude could replace. It is certainly cool that AI
        is becoming so much smarter and is able to do so much more. People in
        Silicon Valley often fantasize about the day when doctors, lawyers,
        writers, and filmmakers are either completely replaced, or have their
        job made significantly easier by artificial intelligence. This is the
        dominant approach to building AI products: look at tough human tasks and
        try to do them as well, or even better, with an AI model. I think this
        approach doesn't dream big enough.

        Beyond Being There, a popular HCI paper from 1992, has a related insight
        about designing interpersonal experiences on the internet. Given that
        there are many very special things about face-to-face interaction like
        eye contact, physicality, and zero-latency communication, experiences on
        the internet ought not to try to be as good as face-to-face
        communication, but be different from it by taking advantage of the
        unique characteristics of online communication. In other words, online
        experiences should have some creative aspect that makes them impossible
        to occur in person. In the best case, this experience may so novel that
        users right next to each other would voluntarily use their devices.

        People should approach building AI products in the same way: beyond
        being human. A great AI product should not simply take something a human
        could do and try to replicate it with an AI model, but should try to
        create new experiences that no interaction with a human could create.
        ChatGPT already has some of characteristics of this style of product:
        instantaneous response times, superhuman knowledge, willingness to do
        mundane tasks, etc. But there are also some aspects that are not being
        put to work by any products on the market: massive parallelization of
        responses, selective amnesia, potential to generate tokens 24/7, and
        probably some others too! My litmus test for this type of AI product is
        whether it creates an output that could never be replicated by any
        amount of humans in any amount of time will create another intellectual
        revolution.

        This threshold might be too high. AlphaFold, one of the most impressive
        research productions ever, technically could have its output produced by
        thousands of the smartest biochemists over the next thousands of years.
        I'm not trying to argue that products that speed up human tasks are
        useless. However, I do think no products that exist today truly live up
        to the full potential of the technology. We have to build for its
        quirks.
