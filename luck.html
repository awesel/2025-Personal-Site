        For the past few months, all my friends have been desperately seeking
        summer work. I assumed that studying CS at Stanford, with its reputation
        and proximity to Silicon Valley, would guarantee us tech job
        opportunities. Unfortunately, even coming from a top institution,
        recruiting is still a pain and nothing is guaranteed, especially as a
        freshman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I am a rookie at recruiting, I've made a bunch of rookie mistakes.
        The most important factor in my success at getting a job this summer was
        luck, but a close second was trying not to repeat my mistakes. There are
        (usually) three stages in applying in tech: resume screening, online
        assessment, and live interviews. I had to fail at each stage once before
        learning how to pass. My resume in September was three pages of
        insignificant information. I only got an online assessment after
        spending a while reading online about how to build a tech resume and
        going to several resume critique sessions. That first online assessment?
        I couldn't solve a single problem. My first live interview was just
        embarassing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most internships are looking for juniors because companies want to
        convert their interns to full-time employees, and freshmen know far less
        stuff than juniors. I can hardly believe how much I've learned in the
        last year. For each class, there are about five problem types that I
        learned how to do, ranging from understanding assembly language to
        writing proofs using induction. For each problem, there are at least
        five facts I must have learned about math or computers that could be
        relevant for work. Even though older people I've talked to claim to
        learn the most important skills while on the job, I can't help but feel
        that three more years of classes would make me an exponentially better
        employee. It's unusual for a company to be enthusiastic about younger
        candidates, for good reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's already a lot of advice online already about how to go about the
        application process. Check out
        <a href="https://evykassirer.github.io/playing-the-internship-game/"
          >this website</a
        >
        for some of the best general advice. To that, I can only add a few
        anecdotes about how people around me found success in finding work in
        their freshman summer.
      </p>
      <h3>Method 1: Big Tech Freshman Programs</h3>
      <p>
        Lots of tech companies offer internships designed for freshmen. This is
        one of the most obvious/direct paths to an internship, so it's also one
        of the most competitive. Google STEP acceptance rate is definitely in
        the low single digits, and I doubt that other programs are much higher.
        Being at Stanford, all of my friends are super talented. I'm
        consistently impressed by their software portfolios and general
        intelligence. Even among them, I only know a handful that got offers
        from big tech first-year programs. These programs are definitely worth
        applying to, but they're not easier to get into just because they're
        targeted at freshmen.
      </p>
      <h3>Method 2: Call Everyone You Know</h3>
      <p>
        I saw a YouTuber advertising his expensive recruiting course. He boasted
        about a very high success rate in finding people jobs. He said the first
        thing he advises his students to do is to go through their contacts and
        call anyone who might be able to help find a job. I'm sure anyone can do
        that without buying his course. This process was kind of embarrassing,
        but resulted in an interview for me. This was my first live technical
        interview, and I did very poorly. Failing this interview helped me
        understand that it takes a lot of devoted effort outside out class to
        get good at technical interviews. It's not the same skill as in-class
        test taking!
      </p>
      <h3>Method 3: Get Lucky</h3>
      <p>
        This is unfortunately the most common way people around me have gotten
        internships as freshmen. Personally, I met my recruiter at a school
        career fair, where I was told they would not be offering an internship
        program. Due to events beyond my control (luck), they changed their mind
        after a few weeks and invited a few people from the career fair for
        interviews. Learning from my earlier mistakes, I spent all my free time
        preparing for the interview, about ~20 hours in the week before the
        interview. I ended up being asked about content I had reviewed just the
        hour before the interview. I hope it's clear how much had to go right
        for me to get a job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of my friends have had similar experiences. One heard back from a
        cold application that they thought they weren't qualified for. A
        recruiter reaches out to another of my friends for a full-time position,
        but, after a good conversation, they agree to hire him as an intern.
        There are clear ways to put yourself in positions to get lucky like
        this, i.e. go to career fairs, be active on LinkedIn, and apply to lots
        of jobs.
      </p>

        <strong>In the end, you probably have to get lucky.</strong>
