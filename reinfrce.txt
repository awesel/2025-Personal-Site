            I'm super excited about this paper. Social science is as concerned
            with what people do as with why they do it, so I think it's awesome
            that these researchers are looking for accurate explanations for
            behavior as well as replicating it properly. Also, from the ML side,
            I haven't seen people use reinforcement learning for this kind of
            task, and I'm curious to see how it works and what kinds of emergent
            behavior it can produce.
